Hello bois.
This here is our Minecraft world repository. Create a pull request and push as usual for edits. Or just upload the world bit by bit as usual similar to how it's presented in this repository. Just drag and drop. Simple as that.

After downloading all the files, compile them all into 1 folder and name it 'world', without the quotations.
